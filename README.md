## Wine

An analysis of 150K wines reviewed in Wine Magazine. The goal of this analysis was to get a better sense of the relationship between price and quality in the context of wine buying. In particular, I sought to answer the question of whether or not wine prices accurately reflect their quality. To measure quality I used Wine Magazine's scores for each wine, which are on a scale of 80 to 100.

In the end, I found that a wine's price often does **not** reflect its quality in a reliable way.
