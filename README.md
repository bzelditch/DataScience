## Wine

An analysis of 150K wines reviewed in Wine Magazine. The goal of this analysis was to get a better sense of the relationship between price and quality in the context of wine buying. In particular, I sought to answer the question of whether or not wine prices accurately reflect their quality. To measure quality I used Wine Magazine's scores for each wine, which are on a scale of 80 to 100.

In the end, I found that a wine's price often does **not** reflect its quality in a reliable way. This is for two main reasons. The first is that there are diminishing returns to price. At the cheaper end of the spectrum ($15 and under), each additional dollar does generally buy you a better bottle of wine, but once you start considering more expensive wines ($60 and up) the marginal benefit to spending more becomes statistically undetectable. This is amplified by the second reason, which is that there is *extremely* high variation in wine quality, at all price points. In fact, I discovered that the difference in quality between a typical $20 bottle of wine and a typical $50 bottle of wine is much smaller than the difference in quality between the best $20 bottle and the worst $20 bottle. These findings hold true across all wine-producing countries and across all grape varietals. The takeaway:  when it comes to buying wine, you're basically shooting in the dark. Your best bet is just to try out a bunch of different wines and see for yourself which ones you like.
